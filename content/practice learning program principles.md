# [[practice learning program principles]]

***Context:** remote, time-constrained professional environment*

- most people will prioritize project work over learning
	- learning will need to be delivered within this constraint > that means recorded sessions on leadership-defined priority topics, recorded and centralized for on-demand viewing
	- these modules can then be plugged into onboarding and workflow processes / documentation
- there are multiple types of learning that require their own differentiated / fit-for-purpose approach and value proposition
	- on the project learning and coaching (hands-on, continuous)
	- 'shadowing' programs
		- people will be interested in the principle but to get traction the program will need to be as close to no overhead as possible
			- this means no 'hands-on-keyboard' work > on-ramping people with project context and providing coaching to ensure ability to add to deliverables is not feasible
			- what this looks like in practice:
				- opportunistic micro-learning marketplaces that piggyback on existing projects and cadences
				- over-the-shoulder problem-solving demos
- learning is best delivered in a multi-level structure
	- Level 100 - inspire / spark interest through broad exposure with clear self-directed next steps available with micro-moments and on-demand modules recorded in real-time when feasible to serve dual purpose and generate visibility
	- Level 200 - build expertise / go deeper through project work, certifications, and CoPs
	- Level 300 - take on a leadership / specialization role
- optimizing reusability means piloting on one project first, then improving and standardizing approaches ongoingly
- all learning should: 
	- assume the use of AI tooling as a copilot or support, done well by [[deep learning ai]]
	- map to high value workflows and a future vision of skills to provide maximum value
